First issue, this app should be voice over friendly for ease of accessibility, you need someone else to help guide you through it without this. Second issue, when asked to enter my card number, it took me to my banking login screen. I am NOT okay with that nor am I taking that chance. I dont care how secure an app claims to be, not going to happen. Third issue, being forced to pick 5 companies and not having the ability to go back and change them later on. This discouraged me at the get go. In the end, I think the idea of this app is great and has potential but it's going to need a lot more work to get there.
